# What’s implemented in this project?

1. Website header:

   * Header becomes fixed on scroll.
   * Highlights the active route you’re on.

2. Smooth scroll implemented.

3. Text hide/show functionality.

4. Block hiding for tablets/phones: if a main block has more than 2 cards, extra content is hidden and a `show more` button appears with a subtle fading overlay, preventing a long photo feed from showing unnecessarily.

5. Tabs.

6. Category filtering: on tablets/phones, clicking a category hides the extra content (from “block hiding” feature) and displays all items in the selected category.

7. Popup modals.

8. Splide slider.

9. Burger menu.

10. On tablets/phones, hover is active immediately; on phones, hover can be triggered by tapping a button.

11. Google Maps integration.

12. Responsive design (Media Queries) for phones/tablets.

13. Masonry grid layout.

14. All images in `webp` format; icons in `svg`.

15. If an element has the `active` class, hover effects are disabled.

16. SEO optimization with `react-helmet`, accessibility tags for screen readers, and Open Graph tags.

17. Code splitting and lazy loading.

18. Light/dark themes.
